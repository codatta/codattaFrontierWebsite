            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We are conducting a study to investigate pricing strategies for data annotation tasks. Participants will
              be asked to complete video evaluation tasks on Codatta.io, a data annotation platform. Participants will
              receive Codatta reward points for each annotation they provide, which translates to a dollar amount (in
              USD) that the participants will be paid.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Participants will be asked to compare and evaluate video clips based on a text query (e.g., “How do I cut
              a mango?”). In order to complete the task, the participants should be familiar with basic website usage
              (e.g., playing a video, entering text).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-2">
            <h3 className="mb-2 text-sm font-semibold leading-[22px] text-[#FFFFFF]">Procedures</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              After providing consent, participants will be redirected to Co-datta.io to complete the task.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              To perform the video evaluation task, participants will be shown a text query (e.g., “How do you slice a
              mango?”) and two videos that attempt to address the query. Participants will be asked which video is
              better at addressing the query, and briefly include a written reasoning for their choice. Then, based on
              the participant’s previous response, the participant will be asked a series of questions with respect to
              the video they preferred.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              After each annotation, participants will be informed of the reward points they earned for their
              contribution. We do not require the participant to perform a specific number of annotations. Instead, we
              ask the participants to complete their annotations before [insert date].

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older. Participants should be familiar
              with basic website usage (e.g., navigating a website, uploading photos) and interacting with chatbots.

            <h3 className="mb-2 text-sm font-semibold leading-[22px] text-[#FFFFFF]">Risks</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those Ordinarily
              encountered in daily life or during other online activities. To protect the participants’ privacy, we
              advise the participants to upload pictures ONLY containing food (i.e., no faces or identifiable
              information in the background).
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              There is a small risk of a breach of confidentiality, as we collect participants’ Codatta ids, Prolific
              ids, or MTurk ids. However, we will minimize this risk by translating these personal identifiers to a
              code, and by ensuring that the papers that have these personal identifiers are stored securely, and will
              not be shared with anyone outside of Carnegie Mellon University.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of
              value to humanity. Participants may contribute towards building better deep learning models for food
              science and investigating better compensation for data annotators.

              Participants will be awarded with Codatta reward points, which reflects a dollar amount that the
              participants will be paid. We will adjust the base amount the participant will be paid to meet at least
              the U.S. federal minimum wage (and be up to $15 USD per hour), prorated for the length per task. There
              will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.
