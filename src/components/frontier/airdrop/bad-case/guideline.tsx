          This project aims to discover and analyze specific errors made by large models when answering objective
          questions. You are required to submit an objective question, an incorrect answer from an AI model (text +
          screenshot), and your detailed analysis of the error, pointing out "where the model went wrong" and "why." You
          do not need to provide the correct answer; your in-depth analysis will directly help us correct the model and
          improve its reliability.
