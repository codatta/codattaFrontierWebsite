          This project aims to discover and correct specific errors made by large models when answering objective
          questions. You are required to submit an objective question, an incorrect answer from an AI model (text +
          screenshot), and directly provide the standard answer for that question. The correct answer you provide will
          serve as a 'gold standard' to help us evaluate and correct the model's knowledge gaps.
