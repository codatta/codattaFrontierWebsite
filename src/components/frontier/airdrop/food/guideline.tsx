          This project aims to co-create a high-quality food nutrition database through the food photos you take and
          your precise annotations. You are required to submit a clear, aesthetically pleasing photo of a ready-to-eat
          dish. Please note: raw ingredients such as raw meat, raw fish, unprocessed vegetables, or unopened packaged
          products do not meet the requirements. Additionally, please provide an accurate food name, quantity, cooking
          method, and estimated calories for the food in the photo.
