          This project aims to discover inconsistencies that arise when top large models answer objective questions. You
          are required to submit an objective question that has a single standard answer, two different answers from two
          AI models (text and screenshot), and what you believe to be the correct standard answer. Each valid submission
          helps us pinpoint AI's knowledge gaps, contributing to its development and improvement.
