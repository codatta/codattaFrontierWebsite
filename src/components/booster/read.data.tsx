                When dealing with cryptocurrency transactions, it's important to assess the potential AML (Anti-Money
                Laundering) risks. AML refers to the laws, regulations, and procedures that financial institutions and
                other regulated entities follow to detect and prevent money laundering â€” the illegal process of making
                large amounts of money generated by criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or fraud, appear
                legitimate.

                <span className="text-lg font-bold">Data transparency</span> is key to effective Anti-Money Laundering
                (AML) efforts, especially in cryptocurrency. Public blockchain data allows regulators to track the flow
                of funds, making it easier to spot suspicious activities like money laundering. Without transparency,
                it's much harder to detect illegal behavior. Transparent transaction records provide the visibility
                needed for real-time monitoring and accountability.
