Please take precautions when searching for Honeypot addresses. Honeypot is a fake address designed to induce attackers to invade. One way to understand Honeypot addresses is to obtain information through reports in the security community or discussion forums. Another method is to analyze transaction history. If an address appears to have no apparent activity or only a one-time large transfer, it may be Honeypot.

Example 1: Honeypot reports that focus on the cyber security community, such as the Honeypot attack incident of the [Bee Token](https://www.thebeetoken.com/) project.

Example 2: Transaction history analysis. If you see some abnormal activity, it may be Honeypot.
