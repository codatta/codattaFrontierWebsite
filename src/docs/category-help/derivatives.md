Derivatives trading platforms usually publicly disclose their smart contract addresses so that users can verify the functions and trading rules of the contracts. To find these addresses, you may visit the official website of the derivatives trading platform or check the relevant blockchain browser.

Example 1: Visit the official website of [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/) to see the smart contract address of its perpetual contract.
