To find phishing addresses, you can look at a list of anti-phishing tools and service providers that often warn users about known phishing addresses.

Example 1: Use cryptocurrency wallets such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), whose built-in anti-phishing tools can help you detect and avoid entering phishing websites.

Example 2: Install anti-phishing browser plugins such as [EtherAddressLookup](https://www.cryptoatlas.io/projects/etheraddresslookup) from MetaMask to provide an additional layer of protection.
