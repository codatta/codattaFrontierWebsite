CEX, a centralized exchange, includes internal collection addresses and user-hosted wallet addresses.

- Hot or cold wallet: Some exchanges will publicly disclose proof of funds' accounts, which are often collected from the exchange's internal collection address (hot or cold wallet). These addresses generally require links to the exchange's margin self-certification, such as Binance's [margin proof explanation link](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-commitment-to-transparency-2895840147147652626), as well as more common ones such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)'s label cloud, and information obtained from social media and field media.
- Deposit address: After registering on different exchanges, you can view your withdrawal address directly and upload the exchange name as the entity information (please do not upload personal information). The following are the general steps: (L1 is likely to be different; L2 may be the same, but the probability of finding differences in the actual process is higher.)
  1. Register and verify account: First, create an account on a centralized exchange. An email address, password, and identity verification are usually required.
  2. Log in to your account on the exchange.
  3. Access deposit options: The exchange's interface has relevant options such as "Assets," "Wallet," or "Deposit."
  4. Select currency: Select the type of digital currency you want to deposit. For example, if you are going to deposit Bitcoin, choose Bitcoin (BTC).
  5. Obtain deposit address: The exchange will provide you with a specific deposit address. This is usually a long string, and the address format may vary for different currencies.
  6. Make a deposit: Send your digital currency from your personal wallet to this address. When doing this, please check the address carefully, as an incorrect address may result in the loss of funds.
  7. Wait for confirmation: After completing the deposit, you may need to wait for the network to confirm the transaction. The number of confirmations depends on the policies of the blockchain network and exchange used.
  8. Confirm arrival: Check your assets in the exchange account to confirm whether the deposit has been successfully deposited.
  9. Safety precautions: Always ensure that you obtain a deposit address from a reliable source and handle your exchange login information and funds carefully
