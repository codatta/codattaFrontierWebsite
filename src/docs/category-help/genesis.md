Genesis addresses are usually found on the blockchain browser because they are the starting point of every blockchain network. To find these addresses, you can use the blockchain browser to query.

Example 1: Use the [Ethereum blockchain browser](https://etherscan.io/) to view the genesis block information of the Ethereum network and obtain the genesis address.

Example 2: Use the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) blockchain browser to query genesis block information of the Polkadot network.
