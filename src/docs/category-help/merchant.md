To find a merchant's address, you may visit the official website of the online store to see if cryptocurrency payment options are available, or find a merchant who publishes their payment address on blockchain.

Example 1: Visit the official website of e-retailer [Newegg](https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/accepted-payment-methods/) to find out if they accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a payment method.
