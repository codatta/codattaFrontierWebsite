To monitor addresses involved in money laundering activities, you must cooperate with companies or institutions that focus on blockchain analysis and regulatory compliance to access their professional tools and databases, which can detect suspicious transactions and addresses.

Example 1: Use [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/) or other blockchain analytics company tools to monitor and detect addresses that may be involved in money laundering activities.

Example 2: Regulatory compliance agencies: Collaborate with regulatory compliance agencies to share suspicious address information to ensure compliance.
