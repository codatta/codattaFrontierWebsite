Service-restricted addresses are usually blocked by exchanges or service providers and may involve suspicious activity or high risk. To find these addresses, you may check the announcements, terms, and policies of the exchange or service provider.

Example 1: Visit [Binance exchange](https://www.binance.com/en) to learn about the addresses that are subject to service restrictions and the reasons for the restrictions.
