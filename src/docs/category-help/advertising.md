Use the query function of blockchain browsers (such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/), [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/)) to search for smart contract transaction records related to advertisements. Check the event log of smart contracts to find addresses related to ads. You may also use blockchain analysis tools for in-depth analysis.

Example 1: Use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and enter the address or keyword of the advertising smart contract in the search bar to retrieve relevant transaction records.

Example 2: Use [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/) to find the smart contract address related to the advertisement on the Polygon network and then check the relevant transaction records.
