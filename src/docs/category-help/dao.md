Addresses of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are usually included in the project's smart contract. To find these addresses, check the project's white paper, official website, or smart contract source code.

Example 1: Read [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/)'s whitepaper to learn about its smart contract address and use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to view related transaction records.
