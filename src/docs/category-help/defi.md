Addresses of decentralized financial projects can usually be found on the project's official website or on the DeFi platform. You can use the DeFi platform application or check the relevant blockchain browser to fins these addresses.

Example 1: Visit [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) to see its smart contract address and details of DeFi products.

Example 2: Use the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) exchange application to learn about its smart contract address and the available liquidity pool.
