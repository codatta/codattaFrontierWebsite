Monitoring multichain interoperability addresses may require checking the official documentation or blockchain browser of the multichain interoperability project. Understand the multi-chain interoperability protocol to identify its cross-chain interaction addresses.

Example 1: Visit the official documentation of the [Wrapped Bitcoin](https://wbtc.network/) project to learn how to interact with the interworking address between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Example 2: Find the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/getting-started)'s cross-chain address to understand the interoperability between different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem.
