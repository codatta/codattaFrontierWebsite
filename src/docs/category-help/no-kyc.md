To find addresses that do not require KYC, you may need to check the policies of the trading platform or wallet provider. These platforms usually explicitly state on their websites whether KYC is required.

Example 1: Check the policy of the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) trading platform to understand its KYC requirements and the limitations of trading without KYC.

Example 2: Visit [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)'s website to learn about its wallet KYC policy and conditions of use.
